# Weather Forecast Microservice
# By: Cody Jennette

# This microservice uses several Python libraries (requests, urllib.request).

# In order for the microservice to function correctly, an internet connection needs to be present on the machine using it.
# The microservice retrieves current location information (city, country, latitude/longitude) based on the machine's external IP.

# Weather is displayed in the following format, as a single string with \n characters separating the lines:

# "City: (machine's current city here) \n
# Conditions: (current weather conditions here) \n
# Temperature (Â°F): (current temperature here"

# Microservice should not require any input parameters, and should run instantaneously when it is called by your program.
